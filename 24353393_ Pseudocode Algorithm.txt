Algorithm1: Find the minimum and maximum values
1. Call the findMinmumMark method and pass the studentMarks array as a parameter.
2. Call the findMaxmumMark method and pass the studentMarks array as a parameter.
3. Create two methods named findMinmumMark and findMaxmumMark.
4 .Initialize a variable minMark to marks[0].
5. For each mark in marks:
      If mark < minMark, 
      minMark = mark
6. Return minMark.
7. Initialize a variable maxMark to marks[0].
8. For each mark in marks:
      If mark < maxMark, 
      maxMark = mark
9. Return maxMark.


Algorithm2: Find the mean and standard deviation of the marks
1. Call the findAverageMark method and pass the studentMarks array as a parameter.
2. Call the findStandardDeviation method and pass the studentMarks array as a parameter.
3. Create two methods named findAverageMark and findStandardDeviation.
4. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
5. For each mark in marks:
      add mark to sum
6. mean = sum / n
7. Return mean.
8.Initialize a variable  sumSquaredDifference to 0.
9. For each mark in marks:
      difference = mark - mean
      squaredDifference= difference * difference
      add squaredDifference to sumSquaredDifference.
7. standardDeviation = (sumSquaredDifference / n)^0.5
8. Return standardDeviation.
