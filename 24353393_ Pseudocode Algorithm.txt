Algorithm1: Find the minimum and maximum values
1.In the main method, call the findMinmumMark method and pass the studentMarks array as a parameter.
2.In the main method, call the findMaxmumMark method and pass the studentMarks array as a parameter.
3.Create two methods named findMinmumMark and findMaxmumMark to find the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
4. Initialize a variable minMark to marks[0].
5. For each mark in marks:
      If mark is less than minMark, set minMark to the value of mark.
6. Return minMark.
7. Initialize a variable maxMark to marks[0].
8. For each mark in marks:
      If mark is bigger than maxMark, set maxMark to the value of mark.
9. Return maxMark.
